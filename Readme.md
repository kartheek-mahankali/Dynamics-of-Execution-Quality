## Problem Statement
The project aims to assess and compare the order execution quality of four major market centers—Citadel Securities LLC, Virtu Americas LLC, Jane Street Capital, and G1 Execution Services LLC—over a four-year period. Using the Net Price Improvement (NPI) metric derived from SEC Rule 605 filings, the study evaluates how these market centers have performed in terms of delivering favorable trade outcomes to their clients. The study focuses on two key performance indicators: the weighted-mean and weighted-median of net price improvement.
## Project Overview
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive Time Series Analysis to explore the trends and shifts in the order execution quality among the selected market centers based on the calculated net price improvement over several years. The analysis specifically looked into how each market center's performance evolved and identified significant changes in leadership in terms of execution quality, particularly noting a substantial shift in performance from Citadel Securities to G1 Execution Services starting from June 2020. This detailed examination included the comparison of weighted-mean and weighted-median net price improvement, providing insights into the consistency and fairness of trade executions by these centers. The project's results are crucial for various stakeholders including traders, investors, brokerage firms, and regulators, helping them make informed decisions and optimize their strategies in the face of changing market dynamics.
