# 12MAR2015 changes:

# Rewrote to use the wtd.quantile function of the Hmisc package,
# instead of the using the erratically-maintained big vis package,
# which had been a problem for folks to get running. The Hmisc package
# is easy to get and well-maintained.

# 16FEB2015 changes;

# Fixed weighting of averages for effective-over-quoted spread ratio,
# to weight for spread and not just share volume.
# Otherwise, the EQ score of 50 for 100 shares is the same no matter what symbol you are trading.
# This had created an apples to oranges comparison because it doesn't account for the difference
# in spreads between the wholesalers.  By adding the spread you eliminate that issue.


# 08JAN2015 changes:

#  * I settled on using the sum of the market-center plus away-executed share counts (my variables
#    mc_exec_shrs + away_exec_shrs, or on the raw 605 form, fields F10 + F11) for share-weighting
#    denominators.
#
#  * I'll focus on market-orders, not marketable-limit-orders
#
#  * worked out weighted-average algorithms for firm-wide means or medians on a measure like
#    net price-improvement, to appropriately weight liquid vs. illiquid tickers.
#
#  * worked out ticker-level grouping, as a step in figuring out firm-level weighted averages.
#
#  * worked the kinks out of the effective-over-quoted spread ratio calculation.

# 06JAN2015 changes:

#   * I added calculations of effective-over-quoted spreads


# 23DEC2014 changes:

#   * I redefined "f605_mktble_select" to "f605_mktble_df," which includes
#     all columns in the analyzed data frame, allowing more kinds of analysis.
#
#   * Most importantly, I fixed a parenthesis mistake in my formulae for net-price improvement, in
#     rows 88-100. The results seem more plausible to those who've reviewed the analysis.
#
#   * I investigate net price-improvement, using different denominators in the share-weighting
#     1) just market center-executed orders. This is the most sensible choice.
#     2) market center-executed plus away-executed shares,
#        because some market centers hold themselves accountable for away-executed shares
#     3) total-orders minus cancelled-orders, an alternative to 2), above.
#
#   * There seems to be a big difference between the price improvement shown for market orders
#     and for marketable limit orders.
#
#   * I'm trying to decide between mean and median of all stocks, as my measure of
#     net price improvment.
#
#   * Some Form 605s report for multiple market centers within a holding company

# calculate a weighted-mean for a market-center's overall net-price-improvement by weighting each row's
# reported amounts of (dis)improvement by the row-level share amounts [yielding the value that I
# dubbed the net_pi_numerator] and then dividing the column-sum of those values by the column-sum
# of executed shares [which I've dubbed mcaway_exec_shrs, including all the row's executions].

# summing the net_pi_numerators I created for each row,

# # ##########
# #
# # Some alternative ways to calculate net-pi
# #
# # ##########

# The weighted mean calculated as above throws away information about row-level and even ticker-level
# trading volume that would help us understand the distribution of price-improvement across stocks.

# It's not obvious how to show boxplots, standard deviations, percentage quantiles
# around such an average.

# People seem to have calculated the weighted-mean that way
# because they don't want illiquid names to get undue weight, and perhaps
# because the calculation is easily done in a spreadsheet or SQL database.

# Consider some alternatives.

# If we want to weight a firmwide average in proportion to liquidity,
# Form 605s report trading volumes for each row, giving us tens of thousands of weights to use.
# A firm's volume in a ticker/order_type/order_size may not be a perfect proxy for liquidity,
# but it's not bad.

# I understand that some firms aggregate the table by ticker, combining all of a ticker's orders,
# then averaging those 8,000-odd ticker-level measures with ticker-volumes as the weights, to get
# firmwide numbers.

# Again, I think that's throwing away information. If our aim is to weight a firm-level average
# in proportion to trading volume, with as much precision as a Form 605 allows,
# a ticker-level aggregation of trading volumes obscures information provided in the raw Form 605,
# where we're given volumes for each order_size and order_type in a ticker (although we're admittedly
# not interested in most of the order_types reported).

# In any event, I'll calculate weighted averages using both
# ticker-level weightings and row-level weightings, and we'll see if there's a difference.


# On lines 187ff, we created 'net_pi_mcaway', the per-row share-weighted price-improvement,
# with the denominator being the row's executed shares (at and away from the market center).
# The column has up to 20 such values for each size/order combo of each ticker.

# First, let's calculate a conventional mean of that column,
# for all a firm's orders in the period under study.
# How does this simple mean compare to the weighted-mean calculated above, in lines 211ff ?

net_pi_mcaway_mean_column <- f605_mktble_df %>%

# Now for 150,000+ rows in three months' reports, compute a column-wise weighted mean of
# each row-weighted average net_pi_mcaway (created on line 187).

# The weights for the columnwise mean will be each row's 'mcaway_exec_shrs'.

# There are two levels of weighting here. First, the row-weighted average net-pi that gives
# appropriate weights to improved and disimproved shares, respectively.

# Second, the column-wise weighting of all the row-level net-pi's,
# with the weights being each row's executed share volume (my 'mcaway_exec_shrs').

# This weighting uses trading volume as a proxy for liquidity (which is never observable anyway),
# so that low-volume rows get less weight than high-volume rows.

# In the wtd.mean() below, the first parenthetical term is what we're averaging, the second
